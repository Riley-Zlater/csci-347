The data we found is used as an approach to predict forest fires using meteorological data, specifically
in the northeast region of Portugal. The data was uploaded to the UCI Machine Learning repository by 
Paulo Cortez and Aníbal Morais of the University of Minho Department of Information Systems in Portugal.
Within our data set we have 13 attribute and 517 instances. Of the 13 attributes two of them are 
catagorical, month and day, and the remaining 11 are numerical. We will be using Label Encoding because
we believe the extra 19 attributes that will be added from One Hot encoding will only muddle our data.
There are no missing values in this data set. This data set is very interesting to both Alex and I
because of the devistating effects wildfires have had in recent years not only in the United states,
but abroad as well. Of the 13 attributes listed we believe rain, wind, temp, ISI, and FFMC will
be the most descriptive attributes for this data set. All of the important attributes have in some way
a relationship with the area attribute which is essentially what this data seeks to predict.
