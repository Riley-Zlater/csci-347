What an astounding paper. The ideas you had with regards to the conclusion of 
this course were pensive, astute, and very pragmatic. It was moving to witness the 
effervescent swirl of information for which I was fortunate enough to be party to. My 
previously held convictions have fallen privy to your subterfuge. Your dissection 
of suffering reminded me of this Shakespeare quote, "We are not ourselves; 
When nature, being oppressed, commands the mind to suffer with the body." lmao
